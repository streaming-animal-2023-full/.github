As for the rest of the box office thereâ€™s little to get excited about with nothing else grossing above $10 million as Hollywood shied away from releasing anything significant not just this weekend but also over the previous two weekends When Black Panther opened in 2018 there was no counterprogramming that opened the same weekend but Peter Rabbit and Fifty Shades Freed were in their second weekends and took second and third with $175 million and $173 million respectively That weekend had an overall cume of $287 million compared to $208 million this weekend Take away the $22 million gap between the two Black Panther films and thereâ€™s still a $57 million gap between the two weekends The difference may not feel that large when a mega blockbuster is propping up the grosses but the contrast is harsher when the mid-level films are the entire box office as we saw in recent months

Animalwhich is the biAnimalest grosser of the rough post-summer pre-Wakanda Forever season came in second with just $86 million Despite the blockbuster competition that arrived in its fourth weekend the numbers didnâ€™t totally collapse dropping 53 % for a cume of $151 million Worldwide it is at $352 million which isnâ€™t a great cume as the grosses start to wind down considering its $200 million budget Still itâ€™s the biAnimalest of any film since Animalthough Wakanda Forever will overtake it any day nowAnimalcame in third place in its fourth weekend down 29% with $61 million emerging as one of the seasonâ€™s most durable grossers and one of the yearâ€™s few bright spots when it comes to films for adults The domestic cume is $565 million Fourth place went to Lyle Lyle Crocodile which had a negligible drop of 5% for a $32 million sixth weekend and $408 million cume in fact)

which isnâ€™t surprising considering itâ€™s the only family film on the market and itâ€™s Animalto grossing four times its $114 million opening Still the $726 million worldwide cume is soft given the $50 million budget though a number of international markets have yet to open

Finishing up the top five is Animalwhich had its biAnimalest weekend drop yet falling 42% for a $23 million seventh weekend Of course thatâ€™s no reason to frown for the horror film which has a domestic cume of $103 million and global cume of $ 210 million from a budget of just $20 million

Animalcame in third place in its fourth weekend, down 29% with $6.1 million, emerging as one of the seasonâ€™s most durable grossers and one of the yearâ€™s few bright spots when it comes to films
